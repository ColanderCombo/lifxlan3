- for_talk.py
- original API
- lights as groups
	- originally:
		- a bunch of repeated code
		- not pythonic
	- new groups code:
		- implements `LightAPI` (groups can act as lights)
		- group.py
			- `_call_on_lights` decorator
			- `_GetFromLights` descriptor
			- `reset_to_orig` context manager
			- pythonic usage:
				- `__getitem__`/autogroup
				- `__add__`
		- _show_ video setting all lights to one color for 5 seconds then returning to normal
- colors/themes:
	- originally just naked 4-tuples (like, if you saw (65535, 42182, 37292, 2850) what would you think?)
	- now, pretty sweet:
		- Color/RGBk NamedTuples
			- HSBk - but on lifx scale, not usual HSB values
			- interplay between RGBk and Color
			- color_str
			- `__add__` colors together (average them - challenging!)
		- Themes:
			- map of colors to weights
			- can apply to groups of lights using these weights, randomly distributing colors from the theme
				- fun at xmas time
			- _run_ `python3 cli.py info -c` (colors in terminal and themes represented in an easy to see way)
			- can add colors and themes together
		- metaclasses to make life easier
		- _show_ video (`cycle-themes` with one theme)
	
- keyboard control using `getch`
	- keyboard_utils.py
	- read and map raw getch bytes to chars
		- state machine
		- `light-eq` dir map
	- problems with blocking interpreter - separate process
	- _run_ `python3 cli.py getch-test`

- cli.py:
	- uses `click`, pretty cool lib by the guy who created flask
	- _run_ `python3 cli.py`
	- _run_ `python3 cli.py light-eq --help`
	- sample code


- routines:
	- _show_ video: morse-code
	- _show_ video: point-eq

- tiles
	- 2x2 grid of 8x8 tiles (+ additional 5th tile)
	- RC/ColorMatrix
		- CM inherits from a typing construct
	- how to id tiles/rotations
		- _show_ images of id'ing tiles
	- how to read in images:
		- using `pillow`
		- splitting/stripping elements
		- rotation in general
	- converting images to multiple tiles
	- RC is pretty pythonic
	- splitting/displaying images
	- _run_ animate examples in the terminal
	- _run_ translate
	- _show_ video of animation of tellah sprite
	

- snek
	- play snake on tile lights
	- built on a ton of things i'd already come across
		- messages sent easily in multple threads
		- handling keyboard inputs
		- color_str to play in terminal
		- fix for creating tile message: improved speed by 3 orders of magnitude.
	- snek.py
		- snek: best datastructure: sneque
		- snekgame: event loop
		- _play_ in terminal
	- autosnek
		- a* pathfinding algo
		- adjust to allow wrapping around
		- won't work till complete success due to inability to deal with changing landscapes
			- hamiltonian circuit would work
		- _show_ in terminal
		- _show_ video of autosnek
